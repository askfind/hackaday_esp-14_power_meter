## The Setup: 

An ESP-14 module is an STM8S microcontroller attached to 
   an ESP8266 in a single module.

Here, the STM8S is running Forth and the ESP8266 is running `esp-link`,
   which serves as a WiFi-serial bridge.

The upshot?  We can connect to the running interpreter in the STM8 over WiFi.

Here goes.
